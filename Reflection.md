## Features
- Any of the radio buttons chosen will output a specific item from that array.
- The Choose Your Own Adventure I chose was the “Entire Meal Functionality”. Each button will output random items (side, main dish, dessert) OR one of each for a meal idea for any user clicking the buttons.

## Deployed Page
Visit our published What's For Dinner Site [here]()!

## Possible Future Extensions
  - A login page would be super cool, if it were responsive in a sense of allowing users login to be saved/recipe ideas they like to be stored within their page.
  - Adding in transitions via CSS would have appreciated.
